**Context: What is SLOP!?**

SLOP! is a new, NYC-based brand offering a delicious and surprisingly healthy take on chia seed pudding. We're targeting busy, health-conscious New Yorkers who need a quick, convenient, and _actually_ satisfying breakfast or snack.

Here's the gist:

- **It's Chia Pudding, But Better:** We're not just throwing some chia seeds in liquid and calling it a day. SLOP! is specifically formulated to be _high-protein_ (50g per serving!), dairy-free, and packed with flavor. Think of it as fuel, not just filler.
- **Key Ingredients:** We use high-quality ingredients like organic soy milk, plant-based protein powder, chia seeds, real blueberries, and real mangoes.
- **The Name:** "SLOP!" is a bit cheeky and memorable. It's meant to be a playful contrast to the typical "healthy food" branding, which can often be boring or pretentious. We're embracing the slightly messy, satisfying nature of a good pudding.
- **The Vibe:** We're aiming for a brand that's down-to-earth, fun, and a little bit edgy, but still clearly focused on health and quality. Think "approachable wellness," not "exclusive wellness."
- **The Goal:** To become a go-to breakfast/snack option for busy New Yorkers, starting with the Lower East Side and expanding from there.
