# SLOP!: It's Not Just Slop, It's a Revolution in a Deli Container.

Forget boring health food. SLOP! is a ridiculously delicious, surprisingly healthy chia seed pudding, designed for busy New Yorkers who demand more from their fuel. We're talking a playful name with a serious nutritional punch. It's "approachable wellness," not pretentious promises.

**Why SLOP! is Awesome (and Good for You):**

- **50g of Protein Power:** That's right, _fifty_ grams of plant-based protein per serving! We're not messing around. This comes from a powerful combination of soy milk ([10](https://www.verywellhealth.com/is-soy-milk-good-for-you-8386140), [12](https://www.webmd.com/diet/health-benefits-soy-milk)) and a premium plant-based protein blend ([15](https://www.premierprotein.com/products/vanilla-plant-protein-powder)). This keeps you full, energized, and ready to conquer your NYC day. It supports muscle building and recovery, too ([13](https://www.livemomentous.com/blogs/all/benefits-plant-based-protein-powder)).

- **Fiber for Days (24g!):** We've packed in a whopping 24 grams of fiber, primarily from the magic of chia seeds ([2](https://www.montagusnacks.co.za/blogs/healthy-lifestyle/health-benefits-of-chia-seeds), [3](https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/speaking-of-health/chia-seeds-pack-nutritional-punch#:~:text=Chia%20seeds%20are%20an%20excellent,developing%20diabetes%20or%20heart%20disease.)). This isn't just about, ahem, _regularity_. Fiber helps regulate blood sugar ([3](https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/speaking-of-health/chia-seeds-pack-nutritional-punch#:~:text=Chia%20seeds%20are%20an%20excellent,developing%20diabetes%20or%20heart%20disease.)), keeps you feeling satisfied ([3](https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/speaking-of-health/chia-seeds-pack-nutritional-punch#:~:text=Chia%20seeds%20are%20an%20excellent,developing%20diabetes%20or%20heart%20disease.)), and even aids in weight management ([8](https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/speaking-of-health/chia-seeds-pack-nutritional-punch)). The Protein Peanut Granola and Chia Seeds supply a good chunk of this fiber.

- **Antioxidant Overload:** We've loaded SLOP! with real blueberries ([17](https://www.ars.usda.gov/plains-area/gfnd/gfhnrc/docs/news-articles/2014/blueberries-and-health/), [18](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7442370/)) and mangoes ([22](https://www.mango.org/blog/mango-benefits/)), bursting with antioxidants that fight free radicals and keep you feeling your best. Think of it as a delicious defense system against the daily grind. These fruits also contribute to improved brain function ([17](https://www.ars.usda.gov/plains-area/gfnd/gfhnrc/docs/news-articles/2014/blueberries-and-health/)), lower blood pressure ([19](https://www.webmd.com/diet/health-benefits-blueberries)), and even better vision ([21](https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/speaking-of-health/the-power-of-blueberries), [23](https://eachnight.com/sleep/benefits-of-eating-mango-at-night/)).

- **Omega-3 Goodness:** Chia seeds are a fantastic plant-based source of Omega-3 fatty acids ([5](https://www.priorityhealth.com.au/blog/2024/04/01/AustralianChiaNaturesTinyMiracleWorkers)), crucial for heart health, brain function, and reducing inflammation ([4](https://teamrwb.org/nutrition/5-benefits-of-chia-seeds-and-flax-seeds)).

- **Dairy-Free Delight:** We use soy milk ([10](https://www.verywellhealth.com/is-soy-milk-good-for-you-8386140)) as our base, making SLOP! a perfect option for those avoiding dairy. Soy milk itself offers benefits like improved cholesterol levels ([11](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/soy-milk-ingredients)) and reduced blood pressure ([11](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/soy-milk-ingredients)).

- **Complete Protein Source:** Chia seeds are complete proteins, with all nine essential amino acids. ([5](https://www.priorityhealth.com.au/blog/2024/04/01/AustralianChiaNaturesTinyMiracleWorkers))

- **Actually Delicious:** Let's be honest, health food can be...blah. SLOP! is different. The combination of creamy soy milk, naturally sweet fruit, and a touch of crunchy granola creates a flavor explosion that you'll actually crave.

\*. **Low Sodium** SLOP! is relatively low in sodium at 275mg.

- **Sustainably Minded:** We're committed to using high-quality, ethically sourced ingredients ([26](https://mammachia.com/)). SLOP! is good for you _and_ good for the planet.

**The Bottom Line:**

SLOP! is a convenient, delicious, and ridiculously nutritious way to fuel your busy NYC life. It's a complete meal in a perfectly portioned, grab-and-go container. At $7.00 a serving, it's a smart investment in your health and well-being, with a hefty profit margin for us (99%!), meaning we can keep making this awesome SLOP!
